## Development Setup

This project is currently intended for developers. To set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository** with submodules:

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/margorski/exodos-launcher launcher
    cd launcher
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run in development mode** (recommended approach):
    - Terminal 1: Start the watch process to rebuild on changes
        ```bash
        npm run watch
        ```
    - Terminal 2: Start the application
        ```bash
        npm run start
        ```

Alternatively, you can build once and run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
